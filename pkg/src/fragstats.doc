			FRAGSTATS (Raster Version)


   USAGE:

      fragstats in_image out_file cellsize edge_dist data_type
          [rows] [cols] [background] [max_classes] [weight_file]
  	  [id_image] [desc_file] [bound_wght] [diags] [prox_dist]
          [nndist] [patch_stats] [class_stats]


      If fragstats is run without the command line arguments, the user
      will be prompted for all the necessary inputs.
	


      NOTE:  (1)  use a $ in place of skipped optional parameters
	     (2)  enter a carriage return for defaults



      in_image:    The name of the input landscape file.  All patches 
		   within the landscape of interest must have patch type
 		   values greater than or equal to zero.  Patches within
		   the landscape border (if present) must have values 
 		   less than zero.


      out_file:    Basename for the output ascii files.  The extensions 
       {char}	   .patch, .class, .land, and .full will be added to the 
		   basename.  The output files contain the following 
		   information: 

		   basename.patch:  Each record contains all the patch
		      level indices for a given patch separated by spaces.

		   basename.class:  Each record contains all the class 
		      level indices for a given class separated by spaces.

		   basename.land:  Each record contains all the landscape 
		      level indices for a given landscape separated by 
                      spaces. 

	           basename.full:  A file containing patch, class, and
		      landscape level indices for a given landscape.  This
		      file is formatted for displaying results.

		   Note that the "basename.patch", "basename.class" and 
		   "basename.land" files are in a format that should
 		   facilitate input to database management programs; they
  		   are not intended for viewing results (records are very
		   long).  Also note that if the files already exist, the
		   information for a given landscape will be appended to
		   the existing files.

		   (The PC version of fragstats uses the extension .pat,
 		   .cla, and .lnd [not .lan so as not to conflict with
                   ERDAS file extensions.])


      cellsize:    The size of cells in meters in the input image.  Cells
       {float}	   must be square.  (The length of one side of a cell 
		   should be input.)


      edge_dist:   The distance from patch edge in meters to use for
       {float}     determining core area (interior habitat).  The core area
		   of a patch is the area remaining after a buffer 
                   "edge_dist" wide is removed from the edge of a patch.


      data_type:   The type of input image file:
       {int}	   
		   1 - SVF file;  this is a file created with the arc/info
		       "gridsvf" command.

		   2 - Ascii file, no header.  Each record should contain 
		       one image row.  Cell values should be separated by a
		       comma or a space[s].

	           3 - 8 bit binary file, no header.

		   4 - 16 bit binary file, no header.

 		   5 - ERDAS image files (4, 8, or 16 bit).
		       (not IMAGINE files)
		   
		   6 - IDRISI image files


      rows:        Optional; the number of rows in the input image.  This 
       {int}       is only required if data_type is 2, 3, or 4.


      cols:        Optional; the number of columns in the input image.  
       {int}	   This is only required if data_type is 2, 3, or 4.


      background:  Optional; the value of (interior) background cells.  This
       {int}	   is only required if there are cells interior or exterior
		   to the landscape of interest that should be ignored.  
		   [default is NONE]

		   Background patch cells inside the landscape should have
		   a positive patch type value.  Background cells in the
		   landscape border and outside the area of interest should
		   be set to a negative patch type value (the negative of
 		   the value used for interior background patch cells).
		   The user must enter a positive value for background 
		   even if the landscape contains only exterior (negative)
		   background cells.
		   
		   Sometimes this convention is difficult to follow.  If 
		   only one type of background is found in the image (only
		   interior or only exterior background), fragstats will
		   verify that each patch has been classified correctly.  If
		   fragstats finds that an interior background patch has been
		   incorrectly classified as exterior background, it will be
		   re-classified as interior background and a message will be
		   issued.  Incorrectly classified interior background patches
		   will also be re-classified as exterior, if necessary.  A
		   warning will be issued about any questionable patches
		   (background patches along the landscape boundary).

		   If background patches along the landscape boundary are
		   not classified correctly, the following indices may not
		   be calculated correctly (class and landscape level):
		   landscape shape index, total edge, edge density, contrast
		   weighted edge density, and total edge contrast index.
		   Beware!
	  
      
      max_classes: Optional; the maximum number of patch types (classes)
       {int}       that could be present in the landscape.  This is needed
		   for calculating relative patch richness.  If a value is
		   not provided, relative patch richness will not be calcu-
		   lated.
                   [default is NONE]


      weight_file: Optional; the name of an ascii file containing weights
       {char}	   for each combination of patch type (class). Each record
		   should contain the numeric representation of two patch
		   types and a weight, separated by a comma or a space[s].
		   Weights should range in value from 0 to 1.  For example:

		        1,2,.25
			1,3,.32
			1,4,.60
			2,3,.45    etc.

		   These weights represent the magnitude of edge contrast
		   between adjacent patch types.  If a file is provided,
		   these weights are used to calculate the contrast weighted
		   edge indices.
		   [default is NONE]

		   NOTE:  Background patch type values should NOT be 
		   included in this file.  Also, a blank line will cause
		   fragstats to blow up!

      id_image:    Optional; the method for assigning patch IDs to each 
       {char}	   patch in the landscape:
 
		   1 -  Create and output an image that contains unique
                        ID's for each patch.  This allows the user to relate
 		        a set of patch statistics to a specific patch in the
			landscape.  This file is given the name "in_image",
	                up to the first dot (".") encountered, and the
			extension .ID.  For example, for an input image
		        named test.dat, the output ID image would be test.ID
 			(not test.dat.ID, so as to be compatible with DOS).
			The "data_type" of this image will be the same as
 			"in_image".

		   2 -  Do not output an ID image (i.e., it's not important
	    	        to relate a set of patch statistics to a specific
		        patch in the landscape).

		   3 -  The name of an ID image to read.  The ID associated
		        with each patch in this image will be written to
                        to output files.  The "data_type" of this file must
		        be the same as "in_image".

		   Input 1,2, or the name of a file. 
		   [default is 2] 


      desc_file:   Optional; the name of an ascii file containing character
       {char}	   descriptors for each patch type (class).  Each record in
		   the file should contain a numeric patch type value and
		   the character descriptor for that patch type, separated
		   by a comma or a space[s].  For example:

		        1  shrubs
			2  conifers
			3  decidious    etc.

		   Descriptive names can not contain spaces!  Use an under-
		   score ("_") or a hyphen ("-") in place of blanks.
		   
		   The parameter MAX_LABEL_LENGTH in the file stats.h 
                   controls the printed length of labels in the output
                   files.  Fragstats is distributed with MAX_LABEL_LENGTH 
		   set to 10.  To change this, edit the file stats.h, change
		   the parameter to the appropriate length, then re-build 
		   fragstats.  Note that if MAX_LABEL_LENGTH exceeds 22,
		   the columns will no longer be aligned in the file
		   "basename.full".

		   If provided, the character descriptors will be written
 		   to the output files.  Otherwise, the numeric patch type
 		   is written.
		   [default is NONE]	


      bound_wght:  Optional; the proportion (equivalent to contrast weight)
       {float}	   of the landscape boundary and background class edges to 
                   be considered edge.  This affects all the edge indices.
		   [default is 0.0]


      diags:       Optional; should diagonal neighbors be evaluated when
       {y/n}	   finding the cells that make up a patch.  If not, then 
		   the 4 cells (not 8) surrounding the cell of interest
		   will be evaluated.
		   [default is YES]

	
      prox_dist:   Optional; the search radius in meters to use for 
       {float}     calculating the proximity index.  If a value is not
	     	   provided, the proximity index will not be calculated.
	           Note that "nndist" (below) must be "yes" if the proximity
		   index is to be computed as they require the same
		   calculations.
		   [default is NONE]


      nndist:      Optional; should nearest neighbor distance be calculated?
       {y/n}       This can be very time consuming on landscapes with 
		   hundreds of patches per class.  Note that this parameter
		   must be "yes" in order for the proximity index (above)
	           to be computed as they are based on the same calculations.
		   [default is YES]


      patch_stats: Optional; should patch indices be written to the output
       {y/n}       files?  If not, the "basename.patch" file will not be
		   created and the patch level indices will not be written
	 	   to the "basename.full" file.  
		   [default is YES]


      class_stats: Optional; should class indices be written to the output
       {y/n}       files?  If not, the "basename.class" file will not be
		   created and the class level indices will not be written
	           to the "basename.full" file. 
		   [default is YES]

		   

      NOTE:  (1)  use a $ in place of skipped optional parameters
             (2)  enter a carriage return for defaults



   NOTES

      (1)  If an index is not calculated, a dot (".") will be output to
           the "basename.patch", "basename.class", and "basename.land"
	   files.  The abbreviation "NA" will be output to the 
	   "basename.full" file.  For nearest neighbor distance, if a
           patch has no neighbors, "NONE" will be output to "basename.full"
	   and a dot to the other files.


   LIMITATIONS:

      (1)  The input landscape file and the patch ID file are stored as
           signed shorts (16 bits) in this program.  Therefore, a landscape
	   may not contain more than 32767 different patch types (this
	   shouldn't be a problem!).  The input (or output) patch ID image 
	   is also limited to 32767 unique IDs.
          
      (2)  Only the first 12 characters of the input image name are 
           written to the "basename.patch", "basename.class", and 
           "basename.land" files.  If the first 12 characters are not
           unique, it will be difficult to distinguish between sets of
	   image statistics in the output files.  (This might occur if
	   fragstats is run on several images with a path specified as 
      	   part of the image name and the output is directed to the same
           files.)
           
      (3)  This program was developed on a SUN workstation.  It is written
           in C and compiled with the GNU C compiler.  It may not compile
           with other C compilers.

      (4)  On DEC or IBM machines, the option of inputting an arc/info SVF
           file doesn't work due to the different architectures of these
	   machines and SUNs.   Contact Barbara Marks for new routines to
           handle this situation.
